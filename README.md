Our Text Adventure Game
The game.py file is an example of a simple text adventure game. The purpose of this game is to practice creating a text adventure game in python. The game is composed of if statements that generate a response based on the player's input. The game is not meant to be fun or interesting, rather an experiment in creating a functional text adventure game in python. 

The zork.json file does not correspond with the game.py file. It corresponds with main.py.
